# Introduction
You've just downloaded a sweet armor mod off the nexus and realized it's only available via a crafting recipe or a single dinky chest in Riverwood.  You want it to show up naturally in your game but lack the knowledge or, more likely, the willpower to manually add it to all the appropriate leveled lists.  You've come to the right place.

Automated Leveled List Addition is an aptly named xEdit script that reduces all aspects of item integration to a single click.  Wait! If this mod is so simple why are there so many goddamn buttons?!?  I've created a [video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0yVEmFrhh4&feature=youtu.be ) covering the features explained below but **~90+% of users will only ever need the 'OK' button**. 

This script is like a Bashed/Smashed Patch for items. This mod doesn't replace Bashed/Smashed Patches. It doesn't have any compatibility issues with Lootification. It's not replacing anything.  This is a totally new tool offering something not found anywhere else.
